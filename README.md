## Usage

To run this program you need python and to know you stop number.

This program currently only does two things. Firstly it gets bus departure times for any given bus stop, secondly it will list recent bus stops that you have searched.

# Bus Stop Search

For example if your stop number is 5500 you'd run:

    $ python main.py stop 5500

# List previous searches

To get all previously searched bus stops just run:

    $ python main.py list
